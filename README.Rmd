# overcoverage <img src="inst/figures/overcoverage.png" align="right" />

A package to estimate overcoverage on register based data considering Multiple System Estimation (MSE) models, based on package `conting`.

## Prerequisites

Before using our package, one needs to install the archived package `conting`. Because the package is archived, we need to install the package in a different way. Using the package `devtools`, we can use the following code

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_version("conting",
                          version = "1.7")
```

Then one can install our package, also using `devtools` with the following lines

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("brsantos/overcoverage")
```
