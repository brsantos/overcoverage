# overcoverage <img src="inst/figures/overcoverage.png" align="right" />

A package to estimate overcoverage on register based data considering Multiple System Estimation (MSE) models, based on the package `conting`. 

The discussion of this method is available on the paper:

- Mussino, E., Santos, B., Monti, A. et al. Multiple systems estimation for studying over-coverage and its heterogeneity in population registers. __Quality & Quantity__ (2023). [https://doi.org/10.1007/s11135-023-01757-x](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11135-023-01757-x)

## Prerequisites

Before using this package, you need to install the archived package `conting`. Because the package is archived, we need to install it in a different way. Using the package `devtools`, we can use the following code

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_version("conting",
                          version = "1.7")
```

After installing `conting`, you can install our package, also using `devtools` with the following lines   

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("brsantos/overcoverage")
```
